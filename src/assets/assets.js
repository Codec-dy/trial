    background: 'My name is Daniel Yormesor, and I am a 23-year-old passionate about technology, problem-solving, and innovation. With a strong background in computer science and accounting, I have spent years honing my skills in software development, data science, and web technologies. My journey into programming began over five years ago, and since then, I have explored various technologies, including PHP, Django, Meteor.js, and now the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and Nextjs. In addition to web development, I have experience in data visualization, machine learning, and web scraping, using tools like Python, Excel, and Tableau to extract meaningful insights from data. Beyond technical expertise, I have a history of leadership and collaboration. I have led and co-led tech-focused clubs, where I fostered a culture of learning and innovation by organizing workshops, mentoring peers, and managing hands-on projects. My ability to communicate complex ideas effectively and work collaboratively has been a key factor in my success as both a developer and a leader.',

During my time there, I co-led an IT club, where I helped foster an inclusive learning environment by organizing workshops, mentoring students, and facilitating hands-on projects that encouraged innovation and collaboration. After UWC, I continued my academic path at Luther College, where I am currently double majoring in Computer Science and Accounting, with a minor in Data Science. My coursework has allowed me to bridge the gap between technology and finance, equipping me with analytical, problem-solving, and programming skills that I apply in both software development and financial analysis. Through my education, I have gained expertise in full-stack web development, machine learning, data visualization, and automation, while also developing a strong foundation in financial modeling, business analytics, and accounting principles. My interdisciplinary background enables me to approach problems with both a technical and strategic mindset, allowing me to create efficient and impactful solutions.' ,
